#### The styleguide

You will need to bundle install for this. The styleguide is built on top of [Hologram](https://github.com/trulia/hologram). Just run `foreman start` as you would do and point the browser to your server address **/styleguide**.

It takes the real site styleguide and adds some (still) cheesy formatting.
